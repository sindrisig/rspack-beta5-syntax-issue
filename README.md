## Bug in Rspack beta5

I found this while testing a update to rspack from webpack. I know that the error occurs in a 3rd party library but i thought that
because this worked in beta4 and latest webpack that this could be a bug in rspack. 

The root code that breaks can be found under `node_modules/@braze/web-sdk/src/ui/js/index.js`.
